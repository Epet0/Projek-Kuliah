Endangered Animal Species Classification System

Background
Indonesia is home to rich biodiversity, including various species of endangered animals that are threatened with extinction due to habitat destruction, climate change, and illegal poaching. 
These threats disrupt not only individual species but also entire ecosystems. Conservation efforts are essential to preserving this biodiversity.
With the advancement of digital technology, deep learning can be used to assist in conservation by enabling accurate and fast classification of rare animals through image recognition. 
This project aims to develop a species classification system for endangered animals in Indonesia using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This system can serve as a practical tool for researchers, 
conservation officers, and the public to identify endangered species effectively.

Objectives
Develop an image-based classification system for Indonesian endangered animals.
Improve identification speed and accuracy using deep learning (CNN).
Provide accessible tools through a user-friendly website platform.

Dataset Used
Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juanzi/teloisland)
Content: Image dataset of five Indonesian endangered species
Class labels: Bekantan, Sumatran Tiger, Orangutan, Langur Monkey, Sumatran Elephant
Split: 70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing

Website System
The classification system was deployed on a website built using HTML/CSS and Flask. Users can:
Upload and photo animal images
Receive classification results
View species descriptions and conservation information
